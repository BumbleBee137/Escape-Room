DIRECTIONS:

Use the arrow keys to turn between walls. Use the number keys (1-9) to select an item in your inventory. Use the mouse to interact with objects.

You've woken up in an unfamiliar room. Navigate picky cats, invisible ink, and more to find your way out.

CREDITS:
Code written by Bee Millie as part of CS 2300 final using some starter code written by Professor Lisa Dion. All files in "Items" folder were
written completely by me. 

TECHNICAL STUFF:
No added installations necessary to run this code beyond that which is needed for CS2300 Graphics Module. I ran this program on
Windows 11. I used parent-child class relationships from module 2 and graphics from module 4.
