DIRECTIONS:

Use the arrow keys to turn between walls. Use the number keys (1-9) to select an item in your inventory. Use the mouse to interact with objects.

You've woken up in an unfamiliar room. Navigate picky cats, invisible ink, and more to find your way out.

written completely by me. 

WALKTHROUGH:
Fix the picture frame and collect the key behind it. Use this key to open the drawer next to the couch. Remove the book from this drawer and put it back in the bookshelf. Move the left cushion on the couch to collect the lighter. Use the lighter to light the candle. Hold the paper from the bookshelf above the candle to reveal a password. Use this paper to unlock the safe. Collect the fish from the safe and feed it to the cat. Pet the cat a couple times until it spits out a fishbone. Use this fishbone-key to unlock the door. 
Extra: Open the curtains to find a cat treat that you can feed to the cat to make it momentarily happy.
